# Udacity project - 6 : Go Ubiquitous

Project created as a part of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree.

Android Wear is an exciting way to integrate your app more directly into usersâ€™ lives. As a new developer, it will be important for you to understand how to perform this integration. This project gives you an opportunity to design a companion app for Sunshine, tying it to a watch face in order to enrich the experience.
